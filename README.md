# Academic Portfolio
A selection of projects/assignments from my undergraduate studies in computer science at Oregon State university.

Descriptions of each project are located within their respective folders. 

# Academic Honesty
These projects may still be in use within the Oregon State University CS curriculum. I do not provide consent to anyone who wishes to copy my code in a way that violates OSU's Code of Conduct ยง4.2.1.
